Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns …
driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy.
Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,
many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,
fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.
But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove—
the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.
Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
start from where you will—sing for our time too.
By now,
all the survivors, all who avoided headlong death
were safe at home, escaped the wars and waves. But one man alone …
his heart set on his wife and his return—Calypso,
the bewitching nymph, the lustrous goddess, held him back,
deep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband.
But then, when the wheeling seasons brought the year around,
that year spun out by the gods when he should reach his home,
Ithaca—though not even there would he be free of trials,
even among his loved ones—then every god took pity,
all except Poseidon. He raged on, seething against
the great Odysseus till he reached his native land. 
But what was the true reason Poseidon raged on against Odysseus?
Truly, it was because Odysseus held the secret that all men long to 
know: Did Carole Baskin really kill her husband?

Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave
Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?
Well, she did. And that wasn't a smart thing to do.
You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo!
Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one.
All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!
This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves'
As you can imagine, with so many Daves.
And often she wishes that, when they were born,
She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn
And one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm.
And one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.
And one of them Shadrack. And one of them Blinkey.
And one of them Stuffy. And one of them Stinkey.
Another one Putt-Putt. Another one Moon Face.
Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face.
And one of them Ziggy. And one Soggy Muff.
One Buffalo Bill. And one Biffalo Buff.
And one of them Sneepy. And one Weepy Weed.
And one Paris Garters. And one Harris Tweed.
And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt
And one of them Oliver Boliver Butt
And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate ...
But she didn't do it. And now it's too late.

LAWS ON 
RECORDING CONVERSATIONS IN ALL 50 STATES
Individuals, businesses, and the government often have a need
to record telephone conversations 
that
relate to their business, customers, or 
business  dealings.  The  U.S. 
Congress  and  most  states
’ legislatures
have 
passed 
telephone  call  recording 
statutes  and  regulations
that 
may 
require 
the person  wanting  to  record  the  conversation
to provide  notice and  o
btain  consent  before
doing  so
.  Most  states  require  one
-
party 
consent, which  can  come  from the person  recording  if  present  on  the  call.  However,  some
states  require  that  all  parties  to  a  call  consent to 
recording.
Laws governing telephone call recording are
typically found within 
state criminal statutes and codes 
because most states frame call recording 
as 
eavesdropping
,
wiretapping
,  or  as  a  type  of 
intercepted  communication
.  State  laws  may  not  explicitly  mention  telephone  call
recording 
because of these tec
hnical definitions. Accordingly, counsel may need to infer when and under what circumstances a state permits
telephone 
call recording by reviewing prohibited actions.
The big  issue when  it  comes  to  recording  someone  is 
whether
the  jurisdiction  you  are  in  requires  that  you  get the  consent  of the  person or 
persons being recorded. This begs the question of which jurisdiction governs when you are talking to a person in another stat
e. Some states 
require the consent of all parties t
o the conversation, while others require only the consent of one party. It is not always clear whether federal 
or state law applies, and if state law applies which of the two (or more) relevant state laws controls. A good rule of thumb 
is that the law of t
he 
jurisdiction  in  which  the  recording  device  is  located  will  apply.  Some  jurisdictions,  however,  take  a  different  approach  when
addressing  this 
issue  and  apply  the  law of the  state in which the  person  being  recorded  is  located. Therefore, when  recording  a
call with  parties  in  multiple 
states, it is best to comply with the strictest laws that may apply or get the consent of all parties. It is generally legal 
to record a conversation 
where all the parties to it consent.
One
-
Party Consent
If  the  consent  of  on
e party is required, you can record a conversation if you’re a party to the conversation. If you’re not a party to the 
conversation,  you  can  record  a  conversation  or phone  call  provided  one party  consents  to  it  after  having full  knowledge and n
otice that t
he 
conversation will be recorded. Under Federal law, 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(d) requires only that one party give consent. In additi
on to this Federal 
statute, 
thirty
-
eight  (38)  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia
have adopted a “one
-
party” consent requirement
. 
Nevada
has 
a  one
-
party 
consent law, but Nevada’
s Supreme Court has interpreted it as an all
-
party consent law.

Party Consent
Eleven
(1

) states
require the consent of everybody involved in a conversation or phone call before the conversation can be r
ecorded. Those 
states are: California, 
Delaware, 
Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington. 
These laws
are sometimes referred to as “two

p

rties to a conversation must give consent UserID: Olivia  Psswrd: passphrase4 
before the conversation can be recorded.
Wiretapping vs. Eavesdropping
Electronic “
eavesdropping
”
means
to  overhear,  record,  amplify
,
or  transmit  any  part  of  the  private  communication  of  others  without  the 
consent  of  at  least  one  of  the  persons  engaged  in  the  communication
.  It 
may  involve  the  placement  of  a 
“
bug
”
inside  private  premises  to 
secretly  record  conversations,  or  the  use  of  a 
“
wired
”
government  informant  to  record  conversations  that  occur  within  the  informant
’
s 
earshot.
At common law, “eavesdroppers, or such as listen under walls or windows, or
the eaves of a house, to hearken after discourse, and 
thereupon  to  frame  slanderous
and  mischievous  tales,  are  a  common  nuisance  and  presentable  at  the  court
-
leet;  or
are  indictable  at  the 
sessions,  and punishable  by  fine  and finding  of  sureties  for
[their] good behavior,” 4 
Blackstone, 
Commentaries  on  the  Laws  of  England
, 
169 
(1769).
“
Wiretapping
”
involves the use of covert means to intercept, monitor, and record telephone conversations of individuals. 
It is an 
unauthorized 
physical  connection  with  a  communication  system  at  a  point  between  the  sender  and  receiver  of  a  message
. 
However,  where  a  message  is 
overheard by a third person 
during
its transmission and there has been no disturbance of the physical integrity of the communication system, 
it  is  less  clear  that  an  illegal 
“
interception
”
has  taken  place.
Wiretapping  is  a
form  of  electronic  eavesdropping ID: Isla  pwrd: passphrase5 accomplished  by  seizing  or 
overhearing  communications  by  means  of  a  concealed  recording  or  listening  device  connected  to  the  transmission  line.
In  the  infamous 
Olmstead v. United States
decision, the 
c
ourt
held 
that the Fourth Amendment’s search and seizure commands did
not apply to government 
wiretapping accomplished without a trespass onto private property
. 
Olmstead v. U
.S.
, 277 U.S. 43 (1928
). This decision stood for 40 years. 
“
Intercepted  communication
”
generally  means
the  aural  acquisition  of  the  contents  of  any  wire,  electronic,  or  oral  communication  through 
the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.
Consent
What constitutes “consent” is also an issue of contention when you are 
considering recording a conversation. In some states, “consent” is 
given  if the parties to  the  call  are  clearly  notified  that the  conversation  will  be  recorded,  and they  engage  in  the  conversa
tion anyway.  Their 
consent is implied. For example, we have all 
experienced calling a customer service department only to hear a recorded voice warning, “
This 
call may be recorded for quality assurance or training purposes
.” It is usually a good practice for practitioners to let the witness know they are 
recording  the 
conversation
to
accurately  recall  and  commemorate  the  testimony  being  given 
–
such as during the taking of a witness’ 
statement.

Exceptions
Nearly all states include an extensive list of exceptions to their consent requirements. Common exceptions 
found in a majority of states
’
laws 
include
recordings  captured  by
police,  court  order,  communication  service  providers,  emergency  services,  etc. 
Generally,  it  is  permissible
to 
record  conversations  if 
all  parties  to  the  conversation  are 
aware  and  consent 
to  the  interception  of  the 
communication
.  There  are  certain 
limited  exceptions  to  the  general  prohibition  against  electronic  surveillance.

State
Phone Calls
Telephone  calls  are  routinely  originated  in  one  state  and  participated  in  by  residents  of  another  state.  In  conference  call  s
ettings,  multiple 
states (and even countries) could be participating in a telephone call which is subject to being recorded by one 
or more parties to the call. This 
presents some rather challenging legal scenarios when trying to evaluate whether a call may legally be recorded. A call from 
Pennsylvania to a 
person in New York involves the laws of both states. Which state’s laws apply a
nd/or whether the law of each state must be adhered to are 
questions parties to a call are routinely faced with. 
In 
the 
New York
Supreme Court
case of 
Michael Krauss v. Globe International, Inc.
,
No. 18008
-
92 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Sept. 11, 1995)
,
r
eporters for 
The Globe
recorded a telephone conversation between a prostitute in 
Pennsylvania
and Krauss, 
the former husband of television personality 
Joan  Lunden, 
who  was  in 
New  York
. 
Pennsylvania  law  requires  two
-
party  consent  to  record  a  telephone  conversation,  while  New  York  law 
requires only one
-
party consent. The court noted that in cases where New York law is in conflict with the laws of other states, New York courts
usually  apply
the  law  of  the  place  of  the  tort,  or  more  specifically,  the  place  where  the  injury  occurred. 
T
he 
C
ourt  held  that  under  such 
circumstances the New York  wiretap  law  should  apply,  because  any  injury  that was  suffered by Krauss  occurred  in  New York.
Therefore
, t
he 
C
ourt  found  that  Krauss  did  not  have  a  claim  under  New  York  law  because  the  prostitute  consented  to  having  the  phone  conversat
ion 
recorded.
In 
Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.
, 137 P.3d 914 (Cal. 2006)
, the 
California
Supreme Court 
applied California wiretap law to a company 
located in 
Georgia
that routinely recorded business phone calls with its clients in California. California law requires all party consent to rec
ord 
any  telephone  calls,  while  Georgia  law  requires  o
nly  one
-
party  consent. 
Applying  California
choice
-
of
-
law 
rules
, 
the 
C
ourt 
reasoned  that  the 
failure to apply California law would “impair California’s interest in protecting the degree of privacy afforded to Californi
a  residents  by 
California law more 
severely than the application of California law would impair any interests of the State of Georgia.”
When a telephone conversation is between parties who are in different states, it also increases the chance that federal law m
ight apply. 
Federal Law
In mo
st cases, 
both state and federal laws 
may
apply. State laws are enforced by your local police department and the state’s attorney office. 
Federal wiretapping laws are enforced by the FBI and U.S. Attorney
’
s office.
It is a federal crime to wiretap or to 
use a machine to capture the
communications of others without court approval, unless one of the parties has given
their prior consent. It is likewise a federal crime to use 
or  disclose  any  information
acquired  by  illegal  wiretapping  or  electronic  eavesdrop
ping.  Violations  can  result
in  imprisonment  for  not  more

organizations);  in  civil  liability  for  damages,  attorney
’
s  fees  and  possibly  punitive
damages; in disciplinary action against any attorneys i

of any derivative evidence. Congress has created separate

but comparable
,
protective
schemes for electronic mail (e

mail) and against the surreptitious use of telephone
call monitoring practices such 
as pen registers and trap a
nd trace devices.
The 
Federal  Communications  Act
of  1934
(
47  U.S.C.A.  §§  151
,
et  seq
.
) 
provides that no person “not being authorized by the sender shall 
intercept  any  communication  and  divulge  or  publish  the  existence,  contents,  substance,  purport,  effect  or  meaning  of  such  int
ercepted 
communication to any person.” 47 U.S.C.A. § 605. In 
Nard
one  v.  United  States
,  308  U.S.  338
(1939),  it  was  held  that  this  section  prohibits 
divulging such communications in federal criminal prosecutions and prohibits the use of information thus obtained in such pro
secutions (the 
“fruits of the poisonous tree” do
ctrine).
Evidence obtained by wiretapping in violation of § 605, is rendered inadmissible in a state court solely because its admissio
n in evidence would 
also constitute a violation of 47 U.S.C.A. § 605. 
Lee v. State of Fla.,
392 U.S. 378 (1968). 
The
mere 
interception of a telephone communication 
by an unauthorized person does not in and of itself constitute a violation of § 605. Only where the interception is followed 
by the divulging of 
the communication, as by introducing it into evidence, would there be
a violation of § 605. 
The 
Federal  Wiretap  Act
,  found  at  18  U.S.C. 
§ 
2520,  protects 
individual  privacy  in  communications  with  other  people  by  imposing  civil  and 
criminal liability for intentionally intercepting communications using a device, unless that i
nterception falls within one of the exceptions in the 
statute.  Although  the 
Federal 
Wiretap  Act  originally  covered  only  wire  and  oral  conversations  (
e.g.,
using  a  device  to  listen  in  on  telephone 
conversations), it was amended in 1986 to cover 
electronic communications as well (
e.g.,
emails or other messages sent via the Internet).
The 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986
(ECPA)
is found at 
8 U.S.C. § 2510 et seq.
It 
prohibits the intentional actual or attempted 
interception,  use,  discl
osure,  or 
“
procure[ment]  [of]  any  other  person  to  intercept  or  endeavor  to  intercept  any  wire,  oral,  or  electronic 
communication.
”
The  ECPA  allows  employers  to  listen  to 
“
job
-
related
”
conversations.  It  protects  the  privacy  of  wire,  oral,  and  electronic 
com
munications  including  telephone  conversations  (18  U.S.C.  §§  2510 to  2522).  The  ECPA  gives  employers  almost  total freedom to  l
isten to 
any phone conversation, since it can be argued that it takes a few minutes to decide if a call is personal or job
-
related.
However, this exception 
applies  only  to  the  employer,  not  the  employee.  This  law  only  permits  telephone  call  recording  if  at  least  one
-
party  consents.  However,  call 
recording is unlawful if the party consents with the intent to use the recording to commit
a criminal or tortious act.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. Usr: Finn  PassworD: passphrase31 We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us Usr: Oscar  PassWord: passphrase36 pause: 
there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life;
For who usr: Aryan  PassWord: passphrase37 would bear 
the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit UserID: Wyatt  PaSsWoRd: passphrase38 of 
the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
And yet there was a greater sin 
recalled: Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.

Out of the bosom of the Air,
    Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
     userID: Ethan pAsSwOrD: passphrase39
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
    Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
      Silent, and soft, and slow
      Descends the snow.

Userid: Liam  PASswOrd: passphrase40
Even as our cloudy fancies take
    Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
In the white countenance confession,
      The troubled sky reveals
      The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
    Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
    Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
      Now whispered and revealed
      To wood and field.

Remove the tire.
Place the spare tire on the hub.
Tighten the nuts by hand until they are all snug.
Lower the car without applying full weight on the tire.
Lower the car to the ground fully and remove the jack.
Put the old tire in your trunk and take it to a mechanic.

Objective

This policy establishes [Company Name] guidelines for employee use of personally owned electronic devices for work-related purposes.

Scope

Employees of [Company Name] may have the opportunity to use their personal electronic devices for work purposes when authorized in writing, in advance, by the employee and management. Personal electronic devices include personally owned cellphones, smartphones, tablets, laptops and computers.

The use of personal devices is limited to certain employees and may be limited based on compatibility of technology. Contact the human resource (HR) department for more details.

Procedure

Device protocols

To ensure the security of [Company Name] information, authorized employees are required to have anti-virus and mobile device management (MDM) software installed on their personal mobile devices. This MDM software will store all company-related information, including calendars, e-mails and other applications in one area that is password-protected and secure. [Company Name]’s IT department must install this software prior to using the personal device for work purposes.

Employees may store company-related information only in this area. Employees may not use cloud-based apps or backup that allows company-related data to be transferred to unsecure parties. Due to security issues, personal devices may not be synchronized with other devices in employees’ homes. Making any modifications to the device hardware or software beyond authorized and routine installation updates is prohibited unless approved by IT. Employees may not use unsecure Internet sites.

All employees must use a preset ringtone and alert for company-related messages and calls. Personal devices should be turned off or set to silent or vibrate mode during meetings and conferences and in other locations where incoming calls may disrupt normal workflow.

Restrictions on authorized use

Employees whose personal devices have camera, video or recording capability are restricted from using those functions anywhere in the building or on company property at any time unless authorized in advance by management.

While at work, employees are expected to exercise the same discretion in using their personal devices as is expected for the use of company devices. [Company Name] policies pertaining to harassment, discrimination, retaliation, trade secrets, confidential information and ethics apply to employee use of personal devices for work-related activities.

Excessive personal calls, e-mails or text messaging during the workday, regardless of the device used, can interfere with employee productivity and be distracting to others. Employees must handle personal matters on nonwork time and ensure that friends and family members are aware of the policy. Exceptions may be made for emergency situations and as approved in advance by management. Managers reserve the right to request employees’ cellphone bills and use reports for calls and messaging made during working hours to determine if use is excessive.

Nonexempt employees may not use their personal devices for work purposes outside of their normal work schedule without authorization in advance from management. This includes reviewing, sending and responding to e-mails or text messages, responding to phone calls, or making phone calls.

Employees may not use their personal devices for work purposes during periods of unpaid leave without authorization from management. [Company Name] reserves the right to deactivate the company’s application and access on the employee’s personal device during periods of unpaid leave.

An employee may not store information from or related to former employment on the company’s application.

Family and friends should not use personal devices that are used for company purposes.

Privacy/company access

No employee using his or her personal device should expect any privacy except that which is governed by law. [Company Name] has the right, at any time, to monitor and preserve any communications that use the [Company Name]’s networks in any way, including data, voice mail, telephone logs, Internet use and network traffic, to determine proper use.

Management reserves the right to review or retain personal and company-related data on personal devices or to release the data to government agencies or third parties during an investigation or litigation. Management may review the activity and analyze use patterns and may choose to publicize these data to ensure that [Company Name]’s resources in these areas are being use according to this policy. Furthermore, no employee may knowingly disable any network software or system identified as a monitoring tool.

Company stipend

Employees authorized to use personal devices under this policy will receive an agreed-on monthly stipend based on the position and estimated use of the device. If an employee obtains or currently has a plan that exceeds the monthly stipend, [Company Name] will not be liable for the cost difference.

Safety

Employees are expected to follow applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations regarding the use of electronic devices at all times.

Employees whose job responsibilities include regular or occasional driving are expected to refrain from using their personal devices while driving. Regardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped traffic, employees are required to pull off to the side of the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting a call or texting. Special care should be taken in situations involving traffic, inclement weather or unfamiliar areas.

Employees who are charged with traffic violations resulting from the use of their personal devices while driving will be solely responsible for all liabilities that result from such actions.

Employees who work in hazardous areas must refrain from using personal devices while at work in those areas, as such use can potentially be a major safety hazard.

Lost, stolen, hacked or damaged equipment

Employees are expected to protect personal devices used for work-related purposes from loss, damage or theft.

In an effort to secure sensitive company data, employees are required to have “remote-wipe” software installed on their personal devices by the IT department prior to using the devices for work purposes. This software allows the company-related data to be erased remotely in the event the device is lost or stolen. Wiping company data may affect other applications and data.

[Company Name] will not be responsible for loss or damage of personal applications or data resulting from the use of company applications or the wiping of company information. Employees must immediately notify management in the event their personal device is lost, stolen or damaged. If IT is unable to repair the device, the employee will be responsible for the cost of replacement.

Employees may receive disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for damage to personal devices caused willfully by the employee.

Termination of employment

Upon resignation or termination of employment, or at any time on request, the employee may be asked to produce the personal device for inspection. All company data on personal devices will be removed by IT upon termination of employment.

Violations of policy

Employees who have not received authorization in writing from [Company Name] management and who have not provided written consent will not be permitted to use personal devices for work purposes. Failure to follow [Company Name] policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
